# Data-Hiding-in-Images-using-Steganography
This project uses steganography to hide secret data (text or files) within images. The data is encoded in the least significant bits (LSB) of the image pixels, making it invisible to the human eye. It includes both encoding and decoding functions for secure data embedding and retrieval.
Please read README_instruction.txt file before use.
